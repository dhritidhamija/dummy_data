ServiceNow Incident Quality Validation Rules

Purpose:
This document defines quality rules used by automated incident quality agents in ServiceNow.

Mandatory Resolution Fields:
Every resolved incident MUST include:

1. Root Cause
   - Technical reason for incident
   - Example: "VPN client configuration issue"

2. Impact
   - Users or systems affected
   - Example: "User unable to access internal applications"

3. Resolution Steps
   - Actions taken to resolve incident
   - Example: "Restarted VPN client and reconfigured settings"

4. Confirmation
   - Proof of service restoration
   - Example: "User confirmed VPN access restored"

Incomplete Resolution Example:
"Restarted server"
(This resolution is invalid and must fail quality checks.)

Valid Resolution Example:
"Root cause was a VPN client misconfiguration. Impacted remote user access. Reconfigured VPN client and restarted services. User confirmed VPN access restored."

ServiceNow Automation:
These rules are applied by Incident Quality Agents before closure.

If any mandatory field is missing, the incident must be rejected.
