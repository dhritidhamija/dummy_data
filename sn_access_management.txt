Title: User Access Request Handling

Overview:
This document explains how ServiceNow support teams should handle user access-related incidents and requests.

Common Access Issues:
- User cannot access an internal application
- Access request stuck in pending approval
- Incorrect role assigned
- Access removed without notification

Initial Checks:
1. Verify that a ServiceNow incident or request exists.
2. Confirm the application name mentioned by the user.
3. Check the user's role assignment in ServiceNow.
4. Validate approval status in the request workflow.
5. Confirm the user's employment and department details.

Resolution Steps:
1. Re-trigger approval workflow if approvals are pending.
2. Assign correct role based on access matrix.
3. Sync user profile with identity management system.
4. Ask the user to log out and log back in to confirm access.

Escalation Criteria:
- Approval workflow failures
- Role mapping issues
- Identity synchronization errors
